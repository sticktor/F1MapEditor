## What it does

- Draw a track from control points or straights and bends, and edit height, banking and width
- Trace a track from a map image: a few clicks in driving direction, the editor finds the road in between and checks the lap
- Lay a live satellite or street map under the track in true metres, so the picture does not stretch as you zoom
- Combine and resize tracks: copy and paste points between windows, scale by a factor or to a length
- Compute the racing line, braking points, corners, sectors, DRS and Straight Mode zones
- Edit the cross-section per range: kerbs, grass, run-off, barriers and the edge angle beside the road
- Place the pit lane, grid and environment objects from the game's own catalogue, add hills and mountains
- Generate ground, racing line and surroundings textures from the track itself
- Check the track against rules learned from the original circuits
- Build a package for the track installer, or swap an installed track directly for testing
- Or build an addon for [Swofty Launcher](https://f1.swofty.net/), with the track's own name in the game's menus

The interface is available in German and English.

## Requirements

| | Download | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| System | | Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit |
| Game | [F1 25 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3059520/F1_25/) | Read only, needed for the catalogue and for building |
| Installer, one of these | **[Swofty Launcher](https://f1.swofty.net/) (recommended)** | Builds as an addon: the track's own name in the menus, no limit of installer slots, install and start from the editor, crash summary after each session. Modded play runs offline and without EA AntiCheat |
| | [EGO GameDatabases Editor](https://apps.sztefek.eu/app/ego-gamedatabases-editor) | Version 1.6.0 or newer, to install a track and activate it once |
| Carrier package | [Algarve International Circuit (Portimao) for F1 25](https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/algarve-international-circuit-portimao-for-f1-25.87333/) | `portimao.zip`, **version 1.0.0 or 1.0.2** (1.0.2 is the current download, 1.0.0 is under the mod page's [History tab](https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/algarve-international-circuit-portimao-for-f1-25.87333/history)). **Not included**. The build uses it as a base, choose it in the build dialog. Do not unpack it |

Drawing and checking a track works without the game. Only building needs the game and the carrier package.

The installer and the Portimão mod are community projects by other authors, please check their pages for terms and updates.
Version 1.0.0 of the mod can crash on AMD graphics cards, which its version 1.0.2 fixes. Tracks built with Mapeditor on 1.0.2 are tested in Time Trial and in Grand Prix with AI pit stops; whether they run on AMD cards is not tested.

## Getting started

1. Download `Mapeditor-<version>-win64.zip` from [Releases](../../releases) and unpack the whole folder.
2. Start `Mapeditor.exe`. Windows may warn about an unknown publisher because the program is not signed.
3. Choose **Project → New from template** or open `werkzeugkasten/strecke/beispiele/teststrecke.json`.
4. Press **F1** for the built-in help.

## Known limitations

- Pit lane on the left of the track is tested through Swofty Launcher, not yet through the EGO installer.
- Lighting and garage light maps come from the carrier track.
- Very long tracks work, but exceed the size of any original (gates, visibility cells), so the checks show warnings.
- Time Trial and Grand Prix are tested most. Other modes are less tested.
- Swofty Launcher: if you remove a track addon, start a new Grand Prix instead of Continue. A saved session on a track that is gone crashes the game.
- The 26-car option only adds the places to the track. The cars themselves need a grid addon, and tracks of the original game hold 24.
- Laps, fuel, tyres and AI times from the track are tested through Swofty Launcher, not yet through the EGO installer. The tyre choice is an estimate.
- Swofty Launcher: when you drive into the pits yourself (pit assist off), the game shows no gate to your pit crew. Under the EGO installer it did. The cause is not found yet.

## Build from source

Needs [Python 3.10 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```powershell
cd Mapeditor
python einrichten.py
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests -q
.venv\Scripts\python.exe packaging\bauen.py
```

The tests skip cases that need files which are not part of this repository, such as the game.

## Safety

The editor never writes to the game folder on its own. Only the explicit quick swap does, and it keeps a backup. Install and
start in the launcher hand over to Swofty Launcher, which restores the game folder after each session. Use this offline, back
up your save data and game database first, and use it at your own risk.
